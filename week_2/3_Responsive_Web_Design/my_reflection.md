# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Responsive web design is building your website to scale to all the different ways and devices that a user will use to view it. This is accomplished by setting all your sizes and display options to be relative rather than absolute, called a fluid layout, and making the css adaptive to the restrictions of the device. I like it and believe it is a good practice because I want my site to be accessible by any potential user. 

Smartphones and tablets have been the leading source of new devices for viewing the web. They all have different specifications - ie resolution and dpi - and made touch as a way of interaction prolific. This requires the developer to use responsive design in order to deliver the proper user experience across all devices. The same is true of new large and higher resolution monitors as they come down in price. New technology, such as google glass, the oculus, wearable tech all will continually shape web design - in terms of presentation and methods of interaction.

Visually impaired people can absolutely use the web. A responsive site should render exactly the same using larger default text sizes in their browser, for example. I am not aware of the specifics of accesibility software for the blind, such as text to speech solutions, but I know it exists. Of course we should design for them as well - again the end goal is ease of use and accesibility for as many users as possible.

This chapter specifically resonated with me - I had innately sought to adhere to some of the specifications here when designing my blog and other pages, because I recognize that all the major websites scale to whatever window size / device you're using. But I didn't know how to do it! I have had many other ahas this week, such as reset.css, fontface and google fonts, and beginner use of HTML5.
