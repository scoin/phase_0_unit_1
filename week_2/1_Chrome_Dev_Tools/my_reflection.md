# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

The document object model is the skeleton of the HTML document. It allows for object oriented classification of HTML elements, which in turn allows those elements to manipulated by CSS and Javascript.

My site and a wordpress.com blog really don't differ much. The wordpress has automatically generated divs and p tags, which can seem a little clunky but all display correctly. The wordpress also has java, which my site does not.

Chrome Web Tools is easy and fun! The amount of functionality is amazing, I did not know how to use any of it except basic elements editing, which I have used in the past.

All concepts were really solidified. Being able to edit and save source files was a big "aha" moment - I really thought chrome web tools was just for debugging. Turns out it's a full on editor!

I did not find nor need any additional resources. The codeschool demonstrations were great.

Here is my codeschool score
