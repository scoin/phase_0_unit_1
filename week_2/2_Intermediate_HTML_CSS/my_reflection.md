# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
* 
Web standards are important! A uniform language and set of best practices ensures easier and less expensive accesibility for users, browsers and developers. It also helps to keep the web's core open and vendor neutral, unlike flash for example.

I'm sorry but I'm not sure what the "standard structure" applies to in this case? If we are talking about the DOM, then yes it makes sense to me because it goes top down, the same way you read a site.

I like the new HTML5 elements because they simplify the DOM and increase readability. I perhaps need to do some more reading because I don't see any enhancement beyond that.

Reset.css is necessary to remove the browser added default styling. This creates a uniform appearance for most or all users. When I added reset.css to my site, it actually broke my header! That will be fixed in the next chapter.

I have used all the majors - Chrome, Firefox, IE, Opera, Safari. Major sites (youtube, google, reddit) all look the same, but smaller sites do have a tendency to look different, usually in respect to spacing and image position. It's bad for both the designer and user not to have a uniform experience.
