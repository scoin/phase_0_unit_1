I learned that it is hard! But seriously, I learned so much from this week. In the technical sense, I learned how to really use all the main CSS properties and create the DOM, as well as to make the site responsive. In the design sense, I learned that there are many ways to do accomplish something, but comparatively very few ways to make it appealing to the eye.

I do like design and ux, although it is likely not my strong suit. It was alot of fun to do all of it, and I spent entirely too much time - I designed two iterations of the site.

My process initially was disorganized, and to just throw css at the stylesheet until it worked. This was not the way to go. Wireframing, adjusting the plan as necessary but ultimately sticking to it, and working from a fresh stylesheet was far more effective.

I want to make the ux better and more organized, though I am not sure how at this point. I also really want to make the site dynamic, like an actual blog. Looking forward to ruby weeks!

It may have been difficult at times to apply the new things I learned, but as they were all necessary, it eventually became second nature. As I said I spent way too much time on this. In my research, I found some properties like box-shadow that I think look really cool. I'm also still blown away by google fonts and fontface, I really thought we were still stuck in the world of web safe fonts. I still do not understand :before and :after, but the results looks awesome.
