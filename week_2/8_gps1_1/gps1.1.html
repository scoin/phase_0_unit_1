  <div><p>1. Pair Programming is simply dividing into groups of two and having one person "Drive" and one "Navigate". It's important to DBC it's because you can, 
  without being dependant on a teacher, share in the knowledge of other people. Since we enter in different times and different cohorts, we can build on
    the experience from people who have just learned to code and can learn from our peers. Pair programming also serves to prepare us for the future because software 
    programming in a professional environment is so often collaborative. We need to be comfortable articulating what we want out of a website and how to best 
    work together to build it.</div>
  </p>
  <div><p>2. The Driver and Navigator system puts two people together into necessary but seperate roles - the navigator setting the course, and driver taking them there.
  Let's say that the driver and navigator are working together on a website and they think that the color scheme would be better served as something different. 
      The navigator would pick the new color scheme, and the driver would write the physical code to implement it.
